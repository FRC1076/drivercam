Sorry.   It was on the to-do, but not done yet.
Get one of the drivecam blue boxes out of the vision/drivecam larger cardboard box.
Look at the label on it (look for .17 or .19.  Either one is fine.)

Plug it into the robot ethernet network, and plug it into the cell phone battery power.
Then open a web browser on the driver station and connect to the video stream.
@dannihu01 You’ll need to connect to the streaming URL, which, I think has the following form:
http://10.10.76.17:5807/action=stream
If that doesn’t work, then just attach to http://10.10.76.17:5807 and see what it suggests.
Use .19 if that is the vision Pi that you get. and port 5809.
