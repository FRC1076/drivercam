# drivercam
Installation and debugging notes, performance evaluation, installation scripts, and user interface

1. Build and installation manual for mjpg-streamer, probably mostly just scraped from the github for mjpeg-streamer.
(we need a documented process to recreate a fresh new driver station on a baseline Raspian disk)

2. Installation setup scripts and the scripts that auto-launch the mjpeg-streamer to make the driver station.  (most of these are in that Vision-2017 repo already, so we should just grab them from there and put them here)

3. Howto assemble driver-camera setup  (desktop with an ethernet switch, and on the robot at a minimum)
   This should include cabling, power requirements, battery and/or wall outlet power, etc...  This could also include a packing list and labeling for the blue box that contains a driverstation kit.

4. Debugging guide on the driver-camera (link light, ping, ip-address check, web page check, check on process, etc...)

5. How to backup and duplicate a new drivercam image for the pi.   (copy backup disk image to SD card, change addresses in setup script, etc...)  This might just be a good pointer to some instructions in the interwebs.
